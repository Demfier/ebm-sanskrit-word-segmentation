# Word Segmentation and Morphological Tagging in Sanskrit Using Energy Based Models

Code for our paper: [Free as in Free Word Order: An Energy Based Model for Word Segmentation and Morphological Tagging in Sanskrit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01446.pdf), accepted at EMNLP 2018, Brussels, Belgium.

Please find the pre-trained model and other data files distributed on zenodo [[link]](https://zenodo.org/record/1035413/#.XGZGj7pKhCV). Some other helper modules too have been provided in this repo inside the `helpers and outdated` folder.

## Getting Started

Please download the 2 compressed files `dir.zip` and `wordsegmentation.rar` to your working directory and extract them into folders named `dir` and `wordsegmentation` respectively.

Your working directory should be as follows

```
Working Directory
| -- wordsegmentation
| ----- skt_dcs_DS.bz2_4K_bigram_mir_10K
| ----- skt_dcs_DS.bz2_4K_bigram_mir_heldout
| -- dir
```


## Prerequisites
* Python3
  * [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
  * [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
  * [csv](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html)
  * [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/pickle.html)
  * [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)
  * [bz2](https://docs.python.org/2/library/bz2.html)
## Instructions for Training
Change your current directory to `dir`

Run the file `Train_clique.py` by using the following command

* ```python Train_clique.py```

To train on different input features like `BM2/BM3/BR2/BR3/PM2/PM3/PR/PR3` please modify the `bz2_input_folder` value in the main function before beginning the training.

Feature  | bz2_input_folder
------------- | -------------
BM2 | wordsegmentation/skt_dcs_DS.bz2_4K_bigram_mir_10K/
BM3 | wordsegmentation/skt_dcs_DS.bz2_1L_bigram_mir_10K
BR2 | wordsegmentation/skt_dcs_DS.bz2_4K_bigram_rfe_10K/
BR3 | wordsegmentation/skt_dcs_DS.bz2_1L_bigram_rfe_10K/
PM2 | wordsegmentation/skt_dcs_DS.bz2_4K_pmi_mir_10K/
PM3 | wordsegmentation/skt_dcs_DS.bz2_1L_pmi_mir_10K2/
PR2 | wordsegmentation/skt_dcs_DS.bz2_4K_pmi_rfe_10K/
PR3 | wordsegmentation/skt_dcs_DS.bz2_1L_pmi_rfe_10K/

## Instructions for Testing

After training, please modify the `modelList` dictionary  in `test_clique.py` with the name of the neural network that has been saved during training. While testing for a feature, please provide the name of the neural net which was trained for the same feature.

We only provide the trained model for the feature `BM2` which was our best performing feature. If the name of the neural net is not changed, then the testing will be performed on the pre-trained model for `BM2` provided in `outputs/train_t7978754709018`

To test with a particular feature vector use the tag of the feature while execution

* `python test_clique.py -t <tag>`

For example:
  * `python test_clique.py -t BM2`

After finishing the testing please run the following command to see the precision and recall values for both the `word` and `word++` prediction tasks

* `python evaluate.py <tag>`

For example:
  * `python evaluate.py BM2`
